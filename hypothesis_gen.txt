 
"The sequence of events 'review request' -> 'assess risks' -> 'prepare special terms' is more common in successful outcomes than in unsuccessful ones."

This hypothesis suggests that when the sequence of events follows a specific pattern (review request, assess risks, and then prepare special terms), it may be more likely to result in a successful outcome.

These hypotheses can be tested using statistical methods and Process Mining techniques to validate or reject them.
