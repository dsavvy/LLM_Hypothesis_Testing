 "The time taken to prepare a contract is shorter when the 'Succession' flow is followed compared to the 'Co-Existence' flow."

This hypothesis suggests that the succession flow, which involves a sequential execution of tasks, is more efficient in terms of time taken to prepare a contract compared to the co-existence flow, which involves parallel execution of tasks.
