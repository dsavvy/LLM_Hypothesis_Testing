Here are three hypotheses in natural language based on the provided business process diagram and event log:

**Hypothesis 1:** "The average time taken to complete the 'Calculate terms' activity is longer when the 'Assess risks' activity is executed before it, compared to when 'Calculate terms' is executed directly after the 'Parallel Gateway'."

**Hypothesis 2:** "The majority of cases that follow the 'Prepare special terms' path have a higher 'resourceCost' compared to cases that follow the 'Calculate terms' path after the 'Exclusive Gateway'."

**Hypothesis 3:** "The 'Send quote' activity is executed more frequently than the 'Prepare contract' activity after the second 'Parallel Gateway'."

These hypotheses are designed to be simple, specific, and testable using SQL queries. Let me know if you'd like me to help with converting them into SQL queries!
