Based on the provided process diagram and event log data, here are three hypotheses in natural language:

**Hypothesis 1:** The average time taken to complete the "Assess risks" activity is longer than the average time taken to complete the "Calculate terms" activity.

**Hypothesis 2:** The majority of credit requests (more than 80%) follow the "Standard terms applicable" path and result in a "Prepare contract" activity.

**Hypothesis 3:** The "Send quote" activity is typically performed by the same resource (person or team) that performed the preceding "Prepare contract" or "Prepare special terms" activity.

These hypotheses are specific, simple, and directly related to the process diagram and event log data. We can convert them into SQL queries to test and validate these hypotheses using the provided data. 

Please let me know if you would like to proceed with converting these hypotheses into SQL queries!
