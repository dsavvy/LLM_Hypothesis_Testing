Here are three hypotheses in natural language that we can use to investigate the process:

**Hypothesis 1:** "Every case that starts with 'Credit requested' eventually reaches the 'Quote sent' activity."

This hypothesis checks if the process is complete and if every case that starts with 'Credit requested' actually reaches the end of the process.

**Hypothesis 2:** "For every case, the 'Assess risks' activity always occurs before the 'Prepare contract' activity."

This hypothesis checks if the parallel gateway is working correctly and if the activities 'Assess risks' and 'Calculate terms' are indeed executed before the exclusive gateway.

**Hypothesis 3:** "For every case, if the 'Standard terms applicable?' gateway is answered with 'yes', then the next activity is always 'Prepare contract'."

This hypothesis checks if the exclusive gateway is working correctly and if the conditions for the gateway are applied correctly.

These hypotheses are simple, specific, and can be converted into executable SQL queries later. Let me know if you'd like me to proceed with creating the SQL queries!
