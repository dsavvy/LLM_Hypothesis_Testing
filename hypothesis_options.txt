Hypothesis 1: The process always starts with the "Credit requested" event and ends with the "Quote sent" event.

Hypothesis 2: Every "Review request" event is directly followed by a "Parallel Gateway" event.

Hypothesis 3: The "Prepare contract" event only occurs after the "Parallel Gateway" event (sid-DF31C711-BCD9-4E21-A0F4-07D81A515F31).

2. "The activity 'Calculate terms' is always performed after the activity 'Standard terms applicable?' with a 'yes' outcome."
   This hypothesis can be used to test the conformance of the event log data to the process model, specifically the conditional logic.

1. **Hypothesis 1: All cases that follow the 'Standard terms applicable?' path with a 'yes' answer will have a shorter total processing time compared to cases that follow the 'no' path.**

   This hypothesis aims to investigate if the decision at the Exclusive_Databased_Gateway 'Standard terms applicable?' has an impact on the overall processing time of a case.

2. **Hypothesis 2: The 'Calculate terms' task is always performed after the 'Review request' task and before the 'Prepare contract' task.**

   This hypothesis tests the conformance of the event log data to the process model, specifically the order of tasks in a specific branch of the process.

3. **Hypothesis 3: All cases that take the 'Assess risks' path will have a higher resource cost compared to cases that do not take this path.**

   This hypothesis aims to investigate if the 'Assess risks' path is associated with higher resource costs, potentially indicating a more complex or resource-intensive process branch.

1. "The process always follows the sequence of activities 'Credit requested' -> 'Review request' -> 'Standard terms applicable?'."

This hypothesis aims to test the conformance of the event log data to the expected process model, specifically the sequence of activities.

2. "For all instances where 'Standard terms applicable?' is 'yes', the next activity is always 'Calculate terms'."

This hypothesis aims to test the decision point in the process model, specifically the routing of cases based on the outcome of 'Standard terms applicable?'.

2. "The 'Prepare special terms' task is only performed when the 'Standard terms applicable?' gateway is answered 'no'."

This hypothesis can be tested by examining the event log to determine if the 'Prepare special terms' task is only performed after the 'Standard terms applicable?' gateway has been answered 'no'.

3. "The 'Send quote' task is always performed after the 'Prepare contract' task and the 'Prepare special terms' task (if applicable)."

This hypothesis can be tested by examining the sequence of events in the event log to determine if the 'Send quote' task is always preceded by the 'Prepare contract' task and the 'Prepare special terms' task (if applicable).
