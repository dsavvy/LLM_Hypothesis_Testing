Process Mining uses event logs from IT systems to reveal how processes truly operate. It bridges process management and data science by uncovering inefficiencies, deviations, and opportunities for improvement. By extracting models directly from data, it offers a reliable view of actual process execution and helps organizations identify the root causes of performance issues.

Hypothesis Testing in Process Mining means posing questions about process performance and using statistics to decide if event log data supports them. For instance, one might hypothesize that a new policy alters process flow. Analysts define a null hypothesis (no effect) and an alternative hypothesis (some effect), gather data, compute metrics (e.g., p-values), and compare them to thresholds. This quantifies the likelihood that observed patterns arise by chance, reducing guesswork.

Data Quality Checking in this context ensures that the extracted event data accurately reflects the real processes. Poor-quality data, such as incomplete timestamps or duplicated records, can lead to misleading conclusions. Hypothesis testing aids in identifying these issues by posing questions like whether the observed frequency of certain activities significantly deviates from what is expected. If, for instance, a subset of cases appears to lack particular events at an unusual rate, analysts can define a null hypothesis stating that the missing rate is in line with normal system variance. By comparing the actual missing rate against a statistical threshold, they can determine if data anomalies warrant further investigation. Such checks extend to validating attributes, detecting outliers, and confirming consistency in event ordering, ensuring robust results in subsequent analyses.

Conformance Checking compares the discovered process model with an ideal or normative model to detect deviations. Traditional techniques highlight where observed behavior conflicts with the expected process, helping organizations understand compliance issues or inefficiencies. By integrating hypothesis testing, analysts can determine whether deviations are statistically significant or random fluctuations. For instance, if a model states that two activities should always occur in succession, one might hypothesize that observed violations follow no particular pattern. Statistical tests can then ascertain if the frequency of such violations is unusually high, indicating a systematic process problem. This evidence-based approach aids in prioritizing remediation, as it focuses on deviations that are both statistically significant and operationally relevant.

Process Enhancement Search focuses on refining an existing process model by incorporating insights gleaned from data. Hypothesis testing supports this by allowing analysts to examine whether proposed changes genuinely improve performance. For example, if a team introduces a new routing rule to shorten lead times, a hypothesis can be formulated stating that the average lead time will decrease after the intervention. By comparing mean lead times before and after the change, analysts can determine if any reduction is statistically significant or merely the result of random variability. Similarly, when searching for best-fit process configurations, one can systematically test multiple alternatives and select the one most strongly supported by statistical evidence. Overall, it provides a rigorous statistical framework across all phases of Process Mining, from data validation to model refinement.
