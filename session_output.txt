 "The presence of a 'review request' activity in the process flow leads to a significant increase in the time taken to prepare a contract."

This hypothesis suggests that when a review request is triggered in the process, it adds a layer of complexity that delays the preparation of the contract. By investigating this hypothesis, we can determine if there is a statistically significant correlation between the presence of a review request and the contract preparation time.


```
SELECT 
  AVG(CASE WHEN "review_request" = 1 THEN "contract_preparation_time" ELSE NULL END) AS avg_time_with_review,
  AVG(CASE WHEN "review_request" = 0 THEN "contract_preparation_time" ELSE NULL END) AS avg_time_without_review
FROM 
  process_data
WHERE 
  "contract_preparation_time" IS NOT NULL
  AND "review_request" IN (0, 1);
```
