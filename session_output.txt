 "The presence of a 'review request' activity in the process flow leads to a significant increase in the time taken to prepare a contract."

This hypothesis suggests that when a review request is triggered in the process, it adds a layer of complexity that delays the preparation of the contract. By investigating this hypothesis, we can determine if there is a statistically significant correlation between the presence of a review request and the contract preparation time.


```
SELECT 
  AVG(CASE WHEN "review_request" = 1 THEN "contract_preparation_time" ELSE NULL END) AS avg_time_with_review,
  AVG(CASE WHEN "review_request" = 0 THEN "contract_preparation_time" ELSE NULL END) AS avg_time_without_review
FROM 
  process_data
WHERE 
  "contract_preparation_time" IS NOT NULL

"The sequence of events 'review request' -> 'assess risks' -> 'prepare special terms' is more common in successful outcomes than in unsuccessful ones."

This hypothesis suggests that when the sequence of events follows a specific pattern (review request, assess risks, and then prepare special terms), it may be more likely to result in a successful outcome.

These hypotheses can be tested using statistical methods and Process Mining techniques to validate or reject them.

"Cases that follow the 'Succession' path tend to have a shorter cycle time compared to cases that follow the 'Co-Existence' path."

 "The time taken to calculate terms is significantly longer when the risk assessment is also being performed in parallel, compared to when the risk assessment is not being performed."
