 "The presence of a 'review request' activity in the process flow leads to a significant increase in the time taken to prepare a contract."

This hypothesis suggests that when a review request is triggered in the process, it adds a layer of complexity that delays the preparation of the contract. By investigating this hypothesis, we can determine if there is a statistically significant correlation between the presence of a review request and the contract preparation time.


```
SELECT 
  AVG(CASE WHEN "review_request" = 1 THEN "contract_preparation_time" ELSE NULL END) AS avg_time_with_review,
  AVG(CASE WHEN "review_request" = 0 THEN "contract_preparation_time" ELSE NULL END) AS avg_time_without_review
FROM 
  process_data
WHERE 
  "contract_preparation_time" IS NOT NULL
  AND "review_request" IN (0, 1);
```

"The sequence of events 'review request' -> 'assess risks' -> 'prepare special terms' is more common in successful outcomes than in unsuccessful ones."

This hypothesis suggests that when the sequence of events follows a specific pattern (review request, assess risks, and then prepare special terms), it may be more likely to result in a successful outcome.

These hypotheses can be tested using statistical methods and Process Mining techniques to validate or reject them.
```
SELECT 
  outcome, 
  COUNT(CASE WHEN event_sequence = 'review request -> assess risks -> prepare special terms' THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) AS sequence_count
FROM 
  (
  SELECT 
    case_id, 
    outcome, 
    LISTAGG(event, ' -> ') WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id) AS event_sequence
  FROM 
    event_log
  GROUP BY 
    case_id, 
    outcome
  ) AS sequences
GROUP BY 
  outcome;

"Cases that follow the 'Succession' path tend to have a shorter cycle time compared to cases that follow the 'Co-Existence' path."

This hypothesis investigates whether the succession path, which involves a more linear sequence of activities, results in faster processing times compared to the co-existence path, which involves more concurrent activities.


```
SELECT 
  path, 
  AVG(cycle_time) AS avg_cycle_time
FROM 
  (
  SELECT 
    CASE 
      WHEN EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 
        FROM activities a2 
        WHERE a2.case_id = a.case_id 
        AND a2.activity_name = 'Activity_B' 
        AND a2.timestamp > a.timestamp
      ) THEN 'Co-Existence' 
      ELSE 'Succession' 
    END AS path, 
    TIMESTAMPDIFF(SECOND, MIN(timestamp), MAX(timestamp)) AS cycle_time
  FROM 
    activities a
  GROUP BY 
    a.case_id
  ) AS subquery
GROUP BY 
  path;
```

"The 'Precedence' path, which involves assessing risks, preparing special terms, and calculating terms, has a higher frequency of loopbacks (i.e., revisiting previous activities) compared to the 'Alternate Precedence' path, indicating potential inefficiencies in the risk assessment process."


```
SELECT 
  path, 
  COUNT(CASE WHEN activity = LAG(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) AS loopback_count
FROM 
  event_log
GROUP BY 
  path
