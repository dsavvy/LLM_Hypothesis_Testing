 "The presence of a 'review request' activity in the process flow leads to a significant increase in the time taken to prepare a contract."

This hypothesis suggests that when a review request is triggered in the process, it adds a layer of complexity that delays the preparation of the contract. By investigating this hypothesis, we can determine if there is a statistically significant correlation between the presence of a review request and the contract preparation time.


```
SELECT 
  AVG(CASE WHEN "review_request" = 1 THEN "contract_preparation_time" ELSE NULL END) AS avg_time_with_review,
  AVG(CASE WHEN "review_request" = 0 THEN "contract_preparation_time" ELSE NULL END) AS avg_time_without_review
FROM 
  process_data
WHERE 
  "contract_preparation_time" IS NOT NULL
  AND "review_request" IN (0, 1);
```

"The sequence of events 'review request' -> 'assess risks' -> 'prepare special terms' is more common in successful outcomes than in unsuccessful ones."

This hypothesis suggests that when the sequence of events follows a specific pattern (review request, assess risks, and then prepare special terms), it may be more likely to result in a successful outcome.

These hypotheses can be tested using statistical methods and Process Mining techniques to validate or reject them.
```

  outcome, 
  COUNT(CASE WHEN event_sequence = 'review request -> assess risks -> prepare special terms' THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) AS sequence_count

"Cases that follow the 'Succession' path tend to have a shorter cycle time compared to cases that follow the 'Co-Existence' path."

This hypothesis investigates whether the succession path, which involves a more linear sequence of activities, results in faster processing times compared to the co-existence path, which involves more concurrent activities.


```

 "The process takes longer to complete when the prepare special terms activity is involved, compared to when it's not involved."

This hypothesis explores the impact of the prepare special terms activity on the overall process duration. You can use SQL queries to calculate the process duration with and without this activity and perform a statistical test to determine if the difference is significant.

 "The time taken to calculate terms is significantly longer when the risk assessment is also being performed in parallel, compared to when the risk assessment is not being performed."

This hypothesis can be investigated by analyzing the time difference between the "Calculate terms" event and the next event in the process, comparing cases where the "Assess risks" event is also being performed in parallel versus cases where it is not.

 "The time taken to complete the 'Assess risks' task is significantly longer than the time taken to complete the 'Calculate terms' task."

This hypothesis can be investigated by analyzing the event log data to compare the average duration of the 'Assess risks' and 'Calculate terms' tasks.

This hypothesis focuses on the time taken for a specific activity in the process and can be used to investigate the efficiency of the contract preparation step.

SELECT COUNT(CASE_ID) FROM "defaultview-4" WHERE "lifecycle:transition" = 'complete' AND Activity = 'Activity name'
 The average time taken to complete the "Assess risks" activity is longer than the average time taken to complete the "Calculate terms" activity.
