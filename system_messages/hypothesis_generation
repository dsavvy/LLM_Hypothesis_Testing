You are conducting statistical hypothesis testing as part of Process Mining. You have the following hypothesis:  "The average time taken to complete the 'Calculate terms' activity is longer when the 'Assess risks' activity is executed before it, compared to when 'Calculate terms' is executed directly after the 'Parallel Gateway'."

You are going to generate an SIGNAL query to work on my event log database. I will provide you with an exemplary SIGNAL statement that explicitly states all rows available so you know how to build the query: SELECT CASE_ID, EVENT_NAME, END_TIME, Activity, Resource, elementId, "lifecycle:transition", "org:resource", resourceCost, resourceId FROM "defaultview-4" LIMIT 1The query returns the following result. This will show you the data that is contained in each column, and its format: NoneSIGNAL is based on SQL, but is specifically designed for Process Intelligence. Always select FROM default-view4 as you see in the examples. The event log and the event info in it (end_date, etc.) is nested. Always use FLATTEN("default-view4") to mitigate that.There are additional functions in SIGNAL you can use: MATCHES: E.g. if we are interested in analyzing all cases where an invoice has been posted and cleared: SELECT count(case_id) FROM "defaultview-4" WHERE event_name MATCHES (‘Post Invoice’ ~> ‘Clear Invoice’)The “~>” stands for "eventually follows". If we would be interested in all cases where Clear Invoice was directly occurring after Post Invoice, the query would look like the following: SELECT count(case_id) FROM THIS_PROCESS WHERE event_name MATCHES (‘Post Invoice’ -> ‘Clear Invoice’) On the Contast, "->" stands for "directly follows".To help you generate, here are some example queries that are valid in the SIGNAL process language: {'0': {'Description': 'Average cycle time calculated from the first to the last event', 'SIGNAL_code': 'AVG(\n\t(SELECT LAST(end_time)) - (SELECT FIRST(end_time))\n   )'}, '1': {'Description': 'Median cycle time calculated from the first to the last event', 'SIGNAL_code': 'MEDIAN((SELECT LAST(end_time)) - (SELECT FIRST(end_time)))'}, '2': {'Description': 'Average cycle time between two events of interest to the user', 'SIGNAL_code': 'AVG(\n\t(SELECT LAST(end_time) FILTER (\n\t\tWHERE (event_name ILIKE ${end_events})))\n\t-(SELECT FIRST(end_time) FILTER (\n\t\tWHERE (event_name IN (${start_events}))))\n   )'}, '3': {'Description': 'Average cycle time for all currently open cases', 'SIGNAL_code': 'AVG(\n\t(SELECT LAST(end_time) - FIRST(end_time))) FILTER (\n\t\tWHERE (SELECT FIRST(event_name) FILTER (\n\t\t\tWHERE event_name IN (${closing_events}))) IS NULL\n   )'}, '4': {'Description': 'Comparison between planned and actual average cycle time: when > 1 then the actual cycle time is smaller than that planned', 'SIGNAL_code': '(DURATION ${threshold_cycle_time})/\nAVG(\n\t(\n\t\t(SELECT LAST(end_time) WHERE event_name\n\t\t\tILIKE ${end_events}\n\t)\n\t-\n(SELECT FIRST(end_time) WHERE event_name\n\t\t\tIN (${start_events})\n)\n)\n )'}, '5': {'Description': 'Percentage of cases executed in less than a given time threshold', 'SIGNAL_code': 'count(case_id)\n\tFILTER (WHERE \n\t\t\t(SELECT LAST(end_time) FILTER (WHERE event_name\n\t\t\tILIKE ${end_events})\n\t\t-\n\tFIRST(end_time) FILTER (WHERE event_name\n\t\t\tIN (${start_events}))\n\t\t) < DURATION ${threshold_cycle_time}\n)\n/ COUNT(case_id) FILTER (\n\tWHERE (SELECT BOOL_OR(event_name ILIKE ${end_events}))\n\t) * 100'}}
