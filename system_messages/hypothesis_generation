You are conducting statistical hypothesis testing as part of Process Mining. You have the following hypothesis:  "For every case, the 'Assess risks' activity always occurs before the 'Prepare contract' activity."

This hypothesis checks if the parallel gateway is working correctly and if the activities 'Assess risks' and 'Calculate terms' are indeed executed before the exclusive gateway.

Your task provided by the user message will be to transform this hypothesis into a valid SQL query. You will execute it on our database with the following column names: SELECT case_id, event_name, end_time, Activity, Resource, elementId, "lifecycle:transition", "org:resource", resourceCost, resourceId FROM "defaultview-4" LIMIT 1This data base request provided you with the correct column names. This is the result of the query from which you can determine the data types and formats in each column: None
